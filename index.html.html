    <H1><p2<body style="background-color:#ebbeff;">1.HISTORY</h1>
<P style="background-color:rgb(251, 249, 249);">For the last many years, the open space near Ganga Satellite leading towards Pune Cantonment Board was filled with filth. 
People used to dump waste over the space even if it was cleaned by the Pune Municipal Corporation.
 The incessant rains in 2019 brought more filth and waste on the banks of Bhairoba Nala which passes through this road. 
Even after repeated complaints nothing changed. It was then the chairman Of Ganga Satellite,
<mark>Mr. Rajesh Mishra</mark> along with <mark> Mr Ganesh kawade </mark>
and a few residents decided to transform this patch. 
The actual work on the began on September 11, 2021 alongwith extensive support from local Corporator Kalinda Punde,
 Dhanraj Ghogare and Vulcan Technology the work of cleaning up the waste, 
levelling the spot, planting Bamboo and other trees for beautification was done.

this started official and then got a turn into private ngo.</P>

 <H1><p2<body style="background-color:#ebbeff;">2.ROLE OF BIODIVERSITY PARK:-</h1>
<br>
<p3>Biodiversity Park is nothing but the effort to make balance between the nature and the mankind. 
As it is clear that 
the most important factor behind extinction and disappearance of any flora and fauna is human population and 
such kind of unbalance has disturbed the whole ecological and biological world.
 Biological diversity is a precious 
usual resource intended for the continued existence of mankind, 
a slow decrease of which might consequence 
inside vanishing of class economic worth in the direction of the person contest.
 The imperfect protection resources 
obtainable have to be listening carefully tactically
 on top of opportunities probable toward giving way the most 
conservation advantage.
 Conserving biodiversity is concerned with restoring the equilibrium between humans 
and atmosphere.
The Biodiversity Park has been established keeping in view so many points regarding conservation of 
flora and fauna.</p3>
<br>

<h4><strong><br><u>Some of the important roles of Biodiversity Park are :</strong></u></h4>

<br>• It serves as nature reserve for the conservation of natural heritage of the city.
<br>• It enhances the quality of urban environment.
<br>• It serves as hub for education, cultural and conservation activities.
<br>• It connects biodiversity to the city and people.
<br>• It promotes eco-tourism.
<br>• It creates livelihood for local communities.
<br>• It serves as living laboratory for understanding the ecological processes and functions.
<br>• It buffers the local weather and serves as sink for Carbon-di-oxide and urban pollutants and serves as 
adaptation to climate change.
<br>• It preserves the rare endemic and threatened plant and animal species of the area</p3>
<br><H1><p2<body style="background-color:#ebbeff;">3. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES</h1>

<br>The establishment and development of a biodiversity park has some aims and objectives. 
Such kind of park is not 
only the centre of recreation but also the centre of conservation of all kinds of flora and fauna including the extinct 
and endangered one. 
<br><h4><u>Some of the important aims for development of Biodiversity Park are:</h4></u>
<br>• To conserve the genetic stock available at the existing site of the park
<br>• To select the threatened and endangered places whose population has 
dwindled considerably in their natural habitat, 
<br>• To establish a Botanical Garden for public awareness and environmental education with special emphasis to 
economically important and endangered species of the region
<br>• To compile the relevant data to prepare and publish “Green Book” for the species which have been conserved 
and multiplied successfully in the botanical garden of the park
<br>• To provide a suitable research/education ground for the local public, students and researchers in order to 
understand the biodiversity of the local ecosystem
<br>
<br><H1><p2<body style="background-color:#ebbeff;">4. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION</h1>
Biodiversity Park has been the necessity and integral part of our environment for proper functioning and existence 
of ecological world. 
Biodiversity is the heritage of nature and it should be conserved both for welfare of the human 
population in particular and the natural environment in general.
 The establishment of Biodiversity Park is one of 
the innovative and positive approaches to promote the conservation of natural resources in urban matrix.
 Due 
to increasing industrialization, human population, overgrazing and urbanization, the biological diversity needs 
strong management strategies and the establishment of Biodiversity Park is one of the strongest efforts in this field. 
It is necessary for protection, conservation, propagation and extension of the genetic resources of the ecosystem.
 It 
needs technical and other important inputs too.
 A biodiversity park must have plants and propagules of different 
species, collected from all the parts keeping in view that they are also the integral part of this atmosphere. 
Much 
more stress should be given on the endangered and threatened species.
